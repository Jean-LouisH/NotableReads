* [Introduction to Algorithms - Thomas H. Cormen](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0262033844&pd_rd_r=C7TPTZWQCJGVD4R1Q6CV&pd_rd_w=No8Se&pd_rd_wg=JoUeq&psc=1&refRID=C7TPTZWQCJGVD4R1Q6CV): "covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor."
* [Introduction to the Theory of Computation - Michael Sipser](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X/ref=pd_sim_14_15?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=113318779X&pd_rd_r=9CAAZ62ZCMHKGH0N8C8F&pd_rd_w=iuY18&pd_rd_wg=5Wwcn&psc=1&refRID=9CAAZ62ZCMHKGH0N8C8F): "A new first-of-its-kind theoretical treatment of deterministic context-free languages is ideal for a better understanding of parsing and LR(k) grammars. You gain a solid understanding of the fundamental mathematical properties of computer hardware, software, and applications with a blend of practical and philosophical coverage and mathematical treatments, including advanced theorems and proofs."
